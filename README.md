# 🧠 Insurance ML Prediction Project

Welcome to the **Insurance ML Project**, a modular, production-ready machine learning pipeline built for predicting insurance response outcomes. This project covers the complete ML lifecycle—from data ingestion to API deployment—leveraging tools like **scikit-learn**, **AWS S3**, **MongoDB**, and **FastAPI**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline that can:

- Ingest raw data from MongoDB
- Preprocess, transform, and balance datasets
- Train and evaluate ML models (Random Forest)
- Serialize and store artifacts in AWS S3
- Serve predictions via a FastAPI web API

## 🔄 End-to-End Workflow

### 1. 📥 Data Ingestion
- Loads raw data from **MongoDB**
- Splits into training and test sets
- Saves outputs as `.csv` in artifact directories  
📄 `src/components/data_ingestion.py`

### 2. 🔧 Data Transformation
- Drops the target column (`Response`) from input features
- Applies transformations (encoding, scaling)
- Handles class imbalance with **SMOTEENN**
- Saves transformed datasets and preprocessing pipeline  
📄 `src/components/data_transformation.py`

### 3. 🧠 Model Training
- Trains a `RandomForestClassifier`
- Evaluates with accuracy, precision, recall, F1
- Saves model and evaluation metrics  
📄 `src/components/model_trainer.py`

### 4. 📊 Model Evaluation & Reporting
- Logs and stores metrics as `.json` files for review  
📄 `src/components/model_trainer.py` (continued)

### 5. ☁️ Model Serialization & AWS Storage
- Pickles models and preprocessor pipelines
- Uploads artifacts to **AWS S3** using `boto3`  
📄 `src/cloud_storage/aws_storage.py`

### 6. 🔮 Prediction Pipeline
- Loads model/preprocessor from AWS S3
- Transforms input and makes predictions  
📄 `src/pipeline/prediction_pipeline.py`

### 7. 🌐 API Deployment
- REST API built with **FastAPI**
- `/predict` and `/train` endpoints
- Accepts input and returns model prediction  
📄 `app.py`

### 8. ⚙️ Configuration Management
- Centralized config in `schema.yaml` and `constants.py`
- Defines input columns, paths, and types  
📄 `config/schema.yaml`, `src/constants.py`

### 9. 🛠️ Logging & Error Handling
- Unified logging mechanism for all components  
📄 `src/logger.py`
